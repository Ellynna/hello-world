I'm an adult student currently attending TCC in Fort Worth. I plan to transfer to either UNT or UTA for my bachelor's.
Most of my previous experience in computers is with hardware and general tinkering here and there. I previously worked as
an electrical CAD designer, focusing mainly on hospitals and data centers. 
Outside of school, I love SciFi and have a collection of original trilogy Star Wars memorabilia. I love to read when I can 
and I enjoy working with stained glass and leatherwork. 
I was diagnosed with ADHD and narcolepsy as an adult, so I developed a lot of organizational strategies over the years to stay productive. 
I have enjoyed all of my computer coursework and I'm hoping to narrow down my area of study while obtaining my Associate's degree.
